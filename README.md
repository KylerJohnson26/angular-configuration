# Angular Configuration

Example of how to set up configuration in an Angular app so that we can build once and deploy anywhere. Accompanies this [post](https://kylerjohnson.dev/build-once-deploy-anywhere/).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
